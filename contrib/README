This folder contains sopel.service and sopel.cfg designed to be distributed by 3rd party distrubtions such as Fedora Project or Arch Linux.

sopel.cfg is a default configuration file for sopel, that assumes the OS is new enough to have /run and /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d

sopel.service is a systemd service file that assumes you are using a rather recent Willie and has no multiple instance support (TODO). It also assumes that the system has a special user named sopel designated for running the bot and this user has access to /run/sopel (should be setup by sopel.conf in /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d), /var/log/sopel and /var/lib/sopel

Default installation paths:
 sopel.cfg	/etc
 sopel.conf	/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d
 sopel.service	/usr/lib/systemd/system
